## CPP-42

#### CPP00
This module introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** through C++, emphasizing fundamental concepts and coding practices compliant with the C++98 standard. The exercises gradually build complexity, focusing on class design and proper code structure.

#### Key Exercises:

1. **Exercise 00: Megaphone**
   - **Objective**: Create a program that transforms input text to uppercase and handles various input scenarios.
   - **Concepts**: Basic I/O, string manipulation.

2. **Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook**
   - **Objective**: Implement a phonebook application with a limit of 8 contacts, featuring commands to add, search, and exit.
   - **Concepts**: Class design (PhoneBook and Contact), arrays, encapsulation, input validation.

3. **Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams**
   - **Objective**: Recreate a missing class implementation (Account) based on a provided header file and log output.
   - **Concepts**: Class construction and destruction, member functions, file handling.

### Key Concepts Learned
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes, member functions, and encapsulation.
- **C++ Syntax**: Proper naming conventions, compilation rules, and file organization.
- **Memory Management**: Avoiding memory leaks and understanding constructors/destructors.
- **User Input Handling**: Validating and processing commands in a user-friendly manner.

This module lays a solid foundation for further exploration of C++ and OOP principles.
