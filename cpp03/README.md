## CPP-42

#### CPP03
This module introduces **inheritance** in C++ through a series of robot classes, building from a base class to complex multiple inheritance scenarios while maintaining C++98 compliance.

#### Key Exercises:

1. **Exercise 00: ClapTrap**
   - **Objective**: Create a base robot class with health/energy management
   - **Concepts**: Class construction, member functions, attributes

2. **Exercise 01: ScavTrap**
   - **Objective**: Implement a derived class that inherits from ClapTrap
   - **Concepts**: Single inheritance, constructor/destructor chaining

3. **Exercise 02: FragTrap**
   - **Objective**: Create another variant of ClapTrap with different abilities
   - **Concepts**: Inheritance variations, method overriding

4. **Exercise 03: DiamondTrap**
   - **Objective**: Combine FragTrap and ScavTrap through multiple inheritance
   - **Concepts**: Multiple inheritance, virtual inheritance, name resolution

### Key Concepts Learned
- **Inheritance Mechanics**: Base and derived class relationships
- **Constructor Chaining**: Order of construction/destruction
- **Access Control**: Protected members and inheritance
- **Polymorphism**: Base class pointers to derived objects
- **Diamond Problem**: Virtual inheritance solutions

This module provides practical experience with class hierarchies and inheritance patterns in C++.
