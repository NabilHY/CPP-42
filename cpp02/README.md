## CPP-42

#### CPP02
This module focuses on **Orthodox Canonical Form, operator overloading, and fixed-point arithmetic** in C++98. The exercises build advanced class design skills while maintaining strict C++98 compliance.

#### Key Exercises:

1. **Exercise 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form**
   - **Objective**: Implement a basic fixed-point number class following canonical form.
   - **Concepts**: Default/copy constructors, assignment operator, destructor.

2. **Exercise 01: Enhanced Fixed-point Class**
   - **Objective**: Add type conversions and stream output.
   - **Concepts**: Constructor overloading, type casting, operator<< overload.

3. **Exercise 02: Operator Overloading**
   - **Objective**: Implement arithmetic and comparison operators.
   - **Concepts**: Operator overloading, static member functions.

4. **Exercise 03: BSP (Point in Triangle)**
   - **Objective**: Determine if a point is inside a triangle.
   - **Concepts**: Geometric algorithms, const correctness.

### Key Concepts Learned
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Mandatory class structure for all exercises
- **Fixed-point Arithmetic**: Alternative to floating-point numbers
- **Operator Overloading**: Making classes work with native operators
- **Geometric Algorithms**: Practical application of custom classes

This module strengthens C++ fundamentals while introducing advanced class design techniques.
